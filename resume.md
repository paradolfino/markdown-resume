*__PROJECTS__*:

#### [GitReaper (Ruby)](https://github.com/viktharien/gitreaper):  
<https://github.com/viktharien/gitreaper>

GitReaper is a helper script written in Ruby that takes care of the heavy lifting for interacting with Git. Instead of sparsely timed independent commits, GR watches for changes in the directory and commits changes every 1 sec automatically, to a pool of commits. The pool is given an ID, a text summary of work, and then pushed to a specified branch.

Notes: This is my current project - I am working on several features: a slimmed down version, a console that does minimal lifting for you but still helps a bit, and general improvements to the code itself.

#### [Reaction Factory (React, Node, SCSS/CSS Flexbox)](https://github.com/viktharien/reactionfactory):  
<https://github.com/viktharien/reactionfactory>

Reaction Factory is a small app enabling quick creation of custom, self-contained React components. Generates React source code that is downloadable - just dl, wire the component into your app by importing, pass it some props, and you're good to go.

Notes: I'm not working on this app at the moment, but I have plans on expanding some functionality and porting to AWS.

#### [React Refactors (React, jQuery, SCSS, CSS Grid/Flexbox ))](https://github.com/viktharien/react-refactor1):  
<https://github.com/viktharien/react-refactor1>

React Refactor is simple refactoring of standard multi-page websites into SPA (single-page applications) with multi-page functionality. So far have completed one. Mobile friendly.

Notes: I have some plans of doing more React Refactors using React, Redux, and Rails.

#### [Firestack Cellar (React, Google Firebase, jQuery, SCSS, CSS Grid/Flexbox)](https://github.com/viktharien/firestack-cellar):  
<https://github.com/viktharien/firestack-cellar>

Firestack Cellar is a tiny app that demos Google Firebase (NoSQL database) backend features with a simple React front-end. Has custom pagination. Mobile friendly. See my projects for a link.

Notes: This was my first "full stack React" app. I don't have any plans on improving it right now.

[Other Projects](https://github.com/viktharien?tab=repositories):  
<https://github.com/viktharien?tab=repositories>

Some other projects I have created include RemL: a markup language that transforms into React ES6/JSX (incomplete, but will change compilation language from JS to Ruby), and a host of programs made with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, KnockoutJS, jQuery, and HTML labeled as "experiments".
